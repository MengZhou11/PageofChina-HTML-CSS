<p>&ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Chinese culture is one of the world's oldest cultures, tracing back to thousands of years ago. Important components of Chinese culture includes ceramics, architecture, music, literature, martial arts, cuisine, visual arts, philosophy and religion. The cultural values of a country influence its national psychology and identity. Citizensâ€™ values and public opinions are conveyed to state leaders through the media and other information channels, both directly and indirectly influencing decisions on foreign policy. The traditional cultural values that influence the psyche of the Chinese people are harmony, benevolence, righteousness, courtesy, wisdom, honesty, loyalty, and filial piety.</p>

<h4 style="color:yellow; padding-top:0em;">&#8026; Ethnic Groups in China:</h4> </br>
	<p id="culture">&ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Officially there are 56 recognized ethnic groups in China, Han Chinese being the largest group. Many ethnic groups, though merge into Han identity, have maintained distinct linguistic and regional cultural traditions. Even within one ethnic group, there are probably diverse groups of people. Various groups of the Miao minority, for example, speak different dialects of the Hmong-Mie languages, Tai-Kadai languages, and Chinese, and practice a variety of different cultural customs. Typically each minority group has their own costumes, festivals and customs. For example, various marriage customs  are found amoung different minority groups. There is actually a museum that features marriage customs of ethnic groups-Guizhou Museum of Marriage Customs. See more about our Minority Tours.- All content from site are from Wikipidia and pictures are from google. </p>
