	<p>In China, Confucianism, Daoism and Buddhism are the three main religious beliefs, with other beliefs as supplementary. Confucianism is a patriarchal religion that reveres heaven and ancestors. Its philosophy is Confucianism. Compared with a traditional patriarchal religion which usually has a religious belief but no philosophy, Confucianism does not have actual religious belief but a philosophy. Buddhism is both a religion and a philosophy. Daoism is both a religion and a school of thought.</p>

<p id="beliefs">&ensp; &ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Chinese are not deeply religious and show a comparative indifference to metaphysical speculation. Chinese culture was perhaps the first to develop an intellectual skepticism concerning the gods. “All land under heaven belongs to the emperor; all people on the land are subjects of the emperor”. This used to be the conception of the imperial power in traditional Chinese culture. As everything depends on and serves the imperial power, so does every religion. Religion as an ideological system must gain the recognition of the monarch. This has been the first criterion of religions. The more an ideological system was recognize, supported and praised by the monarch, the more this ideological system became a religion. - All content from site are from Wikipidia and pictures are from google.</p>
